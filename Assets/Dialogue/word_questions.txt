"Lena turns to that voice.
Of all things to utter words - a coin scale."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"There's no way you can talk.
You're just a scale."
[Speaker]: 'Coin Scale'
"Actually yes.
Just stare at my center frame.
Lena shakes her head in disbelief."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"That's just weird."
[Speaker]: 'Grandfather Clock'
"Yes, yes it is." 
[Speaker]: 'Sword''
""Says the woman who just walked in."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I take that as a complement.
Now, im here to find scrolls.
Maybe one is here, stuffed in a small place."
[Speaker]: 'Box on Ground'
"That's what she said."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Haha! Wow.."
[Speaker]: 'Shelf Book'
"Tell us what it is.
We probably know a thing or two about it.
You might imagine."
[Speaker]: 'Grandfather Clock'
"A ^6Ah ^6-CHOOO!
Ugh..
Crud..
Freakin' yes powder."
"Here, the player as Lena has options to select characters.
Talk to all of them if they wish.
Minimum is two, or the game loops back."
[Speaker]: 'Coathook Hat'
"Hey! It's not time for that right now.
Let's help her out."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Im looking for a scroll or a book, or something, really, that unlocks doors.
Like magically- sealed doors.
Carefully considering her words, she continued.
She didn't want them to know why she was here.
They may use magic against her."
[Speaker]: 'Sword'
"If it isn't a noble act of bravery to break a seal and take battle to whats inside."
[Speaker]: 'Potted Plant'
"Exactly."
[Speaker]: 'Box on Ground'
"Hmmm...I don't think thats what she's asking."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Its supposed to be just words.
I mean - You ARE books..
You ought to know about that."
[Speaker]: 'Shelf Book'
"Hmmm...
Let me see...
A real key, you say.
Or a turn of phrase that few might know.
Mr.Scale, I seem to recall you conversing with another human in this office not long ago.
A phrase was spoken to you."
[Speaker]: 'Coin Scale'
"I remember talking.
Not given a secret."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Just three words, huh.
It'd be easier to put a hide-a-key in here.
What can you tell me? 
Lena turns to the scale."
[Speaker]: 'Coin Scale'
"Does everyone here remember that? 
Rapid fire answering."
[Speaker]: 'Shelf Book'
"Yes, of course."
[Speaker]: 'Potted Plant'
"Yup.It was raining."
[Speaker]: 'Box on Ground'
"I was stuffed up, but yes."
[Speaker]: 'Coat hook Hat'
"Yes." 
[Speaker]: 'Sword'
"Yes, Madam."
[Speaker]: 'Shelf Book'
"Someone sniffed too much Yes Powder.
I'm sure not all of us, in fact, know."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Says the leather book."
[Speaker]: 'Coat hook Hat'
"Haha!"
[Speaker]: 'Coin Scale'
"Three words that form part of the key to the door."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Okay, I'll bite.
Should have brought another snack, speaking of.
Hmmm...Give me a hint."
[Speaker]: 'Coin Scale'
"A new face."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"That should be the whole thing right there.
Is it...^6^6^6 Newcomer?"
[Speaker]: 'Sword'
"Strike One."
[Speaker]: 'Coin Scale'
"Nope."
