"

I want to go to the Library."
[Speaker]: 'The Enchantress'
"(nods)
Straight down from the front door, then up the stairs."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She walks back down the hall determined to beat the Pulse.

[Speaker]: 'The Enchantress'
"(talking quickly, hollering)
Just so you are aware, the Arcane Pulse is getting closer to going off."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Uh oh. Upon entering the library, Lena saw she was right - the trees outside the nearest window glistened brighter in that spine-tingling, powerful purple and blue."
[Background]: 'Library'
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Lena got right to work. This library boasted an impressive size. 
All four walls with shelves, a couple full armor suits in corners, and a chandelier throwing candlelight all around. 
Its rope was secured around a wall hook. But, only five shelves high was every wall stacked; every top one had tools. Magic tools? 
And a few large scrolls set in corners of shelves.
A stack of books lay on a table in the midst."

"Alrighty. A charm like this might be in a box, or on a shelf, or in another rock.
I don't have time to look through all these. Wish I knew an incantation that pointed out the guidebooks. 
That enchantress probably knows this place in-and-out.."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"One shelf had high cupboard doors. Inside were a stack of cookbooks.
Her stomach growls seeing boiling stew and fresh eggs. 
Two more are magic instruction texts."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Does not give me answers."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She rifles through books on another shelf.
Wait, hold on. 
One book has the title ''How to Run a Magical Business for Dummies.'', with a slip of paper sticking out. 
It reads:
''You can't see what lies on the other side without an apprentice, Conwenna. Teaching someone else means the magic keeps in the family. You grow as a person, too.'' "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Wow, that explains things now. 
Rather specific, too."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Where was the charm hiding, however?
A moment later, she facepalms herself. She scurries to the other end of the room. Hiding in a corner by a trio of scrolls is a silver stone. Lena let out a sigh of relief."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I am an idiot for only now considering this spot.
Now I have it all. Let's return to her."
