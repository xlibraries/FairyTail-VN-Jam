"Skylan!"
[Background]: 'ArcaneDoor'
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Lena blinked several times, ran, and knocked hard on it. 
He found himself locked behind a magical door. 
How was this possible?
Something like this isn't as likely as falling in a hole..
This was quite strange."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"This is - wh - what?
Is that you, Skylan? It's me, Lena. What happened?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Beside her, the Enchantress takes a step back, a look of fear in her eyes."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It's.. high-pitched. That sounds like my grandmother!"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"No, that - that isn't possible. That sounds like a male voice^6, and I know what my friend sounds like. 
I thought you said your grandmother had passed away?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Another whisper floats forth from the door. Lena and the Enchantress stare at it in confusion."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Did you smack your head on a rock?
I don't understand what you're saying."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Can you see anything?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Yes, but I know that voice anywhere."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Me as well. Sounds like Skylan."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It's like she left her ghost behind to warn me about something. 
Or have a last laugh. Frightens me a bit."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"She must have a dark sense of humor."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"I'm actually being serious. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(chuckles)
I respectfully disagree that it's her. 
It has to be my friend. 
He must have stumbled behind this door with zero realization.
I need to find out more.
How long ago did your grandmother pass away?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"The Enchantress pauses, frowns, and stirs up an old memory. The answer lightly floats out  of her mouth."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Um, five days ago.
I need to add - I can't directly open it. 
You can ask me what you may need to get it unlocked.
However, I am not allowed to give straight answers."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Details really do matter though, Lena thought. 
The house may or may not be protected from the Arcane Pulse, and whoever is stuck probably won't be. 
And we're running out of time..."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Hmm. What might I need, then?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Relieved, the Enchantress nods acceptingly."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It has a very tough sealing charm - from the inside and outside. 
If one wants to break it, we have an unsealing incantation. 
I tried tweaking it to make it easier. But-"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She shrugs."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Nope.
Her best chance was doing that. Borderline ransacking this house."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Where can I find one?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"In my house."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Lena motions 'Give me more information' with her hand."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"And?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"You can search the rooms. I have a library, a study for my business affairs, and my workshop.
Just don't stick your hand in the forge."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"On a trustworthy level now, Lena thought. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"So, it needs a few words and a metal rod or something to work."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Hah, nope. A set of lockpicks, a charm to unstick tough-to-open jars, and another charm to amplify their effectiveness. 
Put 'em together and they unlock the Forbidden Door's seal.
You can look for them in any order."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Well, shoot. I need to get my ass moving."
[Background]: 'HouseMainHall'
"Lena walked past the workshop on the way to the basement. 
It may have additional tools than the charm to use. But the lockpicks were a core ingredient. "
