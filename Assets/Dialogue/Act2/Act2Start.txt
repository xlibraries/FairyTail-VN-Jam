Skylan!"
[Background]: 'ArcaneDoor'
"Lena blinked several times, ran, and knocked hard on it. He
found himself locked behind a magical door. This one - how?
Its not like it is dusk outside and fell in a hole."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Alright, that means I am staying.
Is that you, Skylan? Its Lena. What
happened?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(Taken aback)
Its high pitched. There is no way Sounds like: my grandma."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"That isn't possible. Sounds like a
male voice and I know what my
friend sounds like. I thought you
said your Grandmother had passed
away?
The voice sounds off a second time.
(To the door)
Did you smack your head on a rock?
I don't understand what you're
saying."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Can you see anything?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Yes, but I know that voice
anywhere."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Me as well. Sounds like Skylan."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It's like she left her ghost behind
to warn me about something. Or have
a last laugh. Frightens me a bit."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"She must have a dark sense of
humor."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"I'm actually being serious. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(chuckles)
 I respectfully disagree its her. 
It has to be my friend. He must
have stumbled behind this door with
zero realization. I need to find
out more.
How long ago did your grandmother
pass away?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(sniffles)
Um, five days ago.
I need to add - I can't directly
open it. You can ask me what you
may need to get it unlocked.
However, I am not allowed to give
straight answers.
Details really do matter though, Lena thought. The house may
or may not be protected from the Arcane Pulse, and whoever
is stuck probably won't be. Time is ticking also."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Hmm. What might I need, then?
Relieved, the Enchantress' nods acceptingly."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It has a very tough sealing charm -
from the inside and outside. If one
wants to break it, we have an
unsealing incantation. I tried
tweaking it to make it easier. But-"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She shrugs"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Nope.
Her best chance was doing that. Borderline ransacking this
house."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Where can I find one?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"In my house.
Lena motions "Give me more information" with her hand."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"And?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"You can search the rooms. I have a
library, and a study for my
business afairs, and my workshop.
Just don't stick your hand in the
forge. 
Writer's Note: changing to library again.
On a trustworthy level now, Lena thought. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"So, it needs a few words and a
metal rod or something to work."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Hah, nope. A set of lockpicks, a
charm to unstick tough-to-open
jars, and another charm to amplify
their effectiveness. Put 'em
together and they unlock the
Forbidden Door's seal.
You can look in them in any order."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Well, shoot. I need to get my ass
moving."
[Background]: 'HouseMainHall'
"Lena walked past the workshop on the way to the basement. It
may have additional tools than the charm to use. But the
lockpicks were a core ingredient. "
