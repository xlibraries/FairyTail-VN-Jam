"Two found. Two to find. Unlocking that door and freeing
Skylan was that much closer. Lena held the charm up to the
Enchantress'."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Good work. 
I bet the heat almost burnt your
arm hair."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Fortunate it was not a first degree
burn."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(grimaces)
Sorry.
How many more pieces do you need?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"One: the unsealing charm itself.
In the kitchen, you said?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(nods)
Straight down from the front door.
I wish she were more specific, Lena thought. She walked back
down the hall."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(talking quickly with a
raised pitch)
Just so you are aware, the Arcane
Pulse is getting closer to going
off.
Uh oh. And upon entering the kitchen, Lena saw she was right
- the trees outside a window glistened even more in its
powerful purple and blue."
[Background]: 'Kitchen'
"Either the Enchantress' cooks a hell of a lot for one person or
she made many magic-based foods for guests. Several shelves
with pots, pans, skillets, and a couple wide cauldrons. She
flipped open cupboards and drawers and a pantry filled with
various sized jars. 
Maybe I missed it, Lena thought. 
One cupboard had a stack of books with pictures of foods.
Flipping through two of thems found only breakfast recepies.
Her stomach growled. Wait, hold on. On the page was a
recepie for an oath. A note was stuck in the spine. It read:
You can't see what lies on the
other side without an apprentice,
(E's real name). Teaching someone
else means the magic keeps going.
You grow as a person, too.
The Enchantress' enjoys the family business. She hates 
this oath part of it."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Wow, thats crazy.
It made a lot more sense to her. What where was the charm
hiding, however?
A moment later:"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(facepalm)
She scurried back to the pantry. Inside, hovering at a
corner behind a jar it leaned - a flat, chestnut-colored
circle. Lena let out a sigh of relief. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I am an idiot for not seeing that.
(for player)
Now I have it all. Lets go back to
her."
[Background]: 'LivingRoom'
"Skylan wouldn't die on her watch. Shortly, the cover of
Strand's Crossing will shield them.
Jogging to the living area, Lena extended the elements in
her hands. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"All four pieces. Here you are."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(nods approvingly)
You did it. Was it difficult?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I missed a few details the first
time."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"You will need to be more aware as
you learn."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(rolls eyes)
Yeah, I realize that. Skylan
teaches me."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"That's good. Or I can. Let's
unseal that door first.
You have no idea how eager I am."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Oh, I do know.
I know its you, Skylan, Lena thouught. The Enchantress has
the wrong hunch. But, I guess we will see."
