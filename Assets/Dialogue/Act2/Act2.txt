Skylan!"
[Background]: 'ArcaneDoor'
"Lena blinked several times, ran, and knocked hard on it. He
found himself locked behind a magical door. This one - how?
Its not like it is dusk outside and fell in a hole."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Alright, that means I am staying.
Is that you, Skylan? Its Lena. What
happened?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(Taken aback)
Its high pitched. There is no way Sounds like: my grandma."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"That isn't possible. Sounds like a
male voice and I know what my
friend sounds like. I thought you
said your Grandmother had passed
away?
The voice sounds off a second time.
(To the door)
Did you smack your head on a rock?
I don't understand what you're
saying."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Can you see anything?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Yes, but I know that voice
anywhere."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Me as well. Sounds like Skylan."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It's like she left her ghost behind
to warn me about something. Or have
a last laugh. Frightens me a bit."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"She must have a dark sense of
humor."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"I'm actually being serious. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(chuckles)
 I respectfully disagree its her. 
It has to be my friend. He must
have stumbled behind this door with
zero realization. I need to find
out more.
How long ago did your grandmother
pass away?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(sniffles)
Um, five days ago.
I need to add - I can't directly
open it. You can ask me what you
may need to get it unlocked.
However, I am not allowed to give
straight answers.
Details really do matter though, Lena thought. The house may
or may not be protected from the Arcane Pulse, and whoever
is stuck probably won't be. Time is ticking also."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Hmm. What might I need, then?
Relieved, the Enchantress' nods acceptingly."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It has a very tough sealing charm -
from the inside and outside. If one
wants to break it, we have an
unsealing incantation. I tried
tweaking it to make it easier. But-"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She shrugs"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Nope.
Her best chance was doing that. Borderline ransacking this
house."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Where can I find one?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"In my house.
Lena motions "Give me more information" with her hand."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"And?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"You can search the rooms. I have a
library, and a study for my
business afairs, and my workshop.
Just don't stick your hand in the
forge. 
Writer's Note: changing to library again.
On a trustworthy level now, Lena thought. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"So, it needs a few words and a
metal rod or something to work."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Hah, nope. A set of lockpicks, a
charm to unstick tough-to-open
jars, and another charm to amplify
their effectiveness. Put 'em
together and they unlock the
Forbidden Door's seal.
You can look in them in any order."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Well, shoot. I need to get my ass
moving."
[Background]: 'HouseMainHall'
"Lena walked past the workshop on the way to the basement. It
may have additional tools than the charm to use. But the
lockpicks were a core ingredient. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
[Choice]: 'Workshop.,Act2/Act2Workshop.txt,Kitchen.,Act2/Act2Kitchen.txt,Study.,Act2Study.txt'
"I will start in the:"
[Background]: 'HouseMainHall'
"Two found. Two to find. Unlocking that door and freeing
Skylan was that much closer. Lena held the charm up to the
Enchantress'."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Good work. 
I bet the heat almost burnt your
arm hair."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Fortunate it was not a first degree
burn."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(grimaces)
Sorry.
How many more pieces do you need?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"One: the unsealing charm itself.
In the kitchen, you said?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(nods)
Straight down from the front door.
I wish she were more specific, Lena thought. She walked back
down the hall."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(talking quickly with a
raised pitch)
Just so you are aware, the Arcane
Pulse is getting closer to going
off.
Uh oh. And upon entering the kitchen, Lena saw she was right
- the trees outside a window glistened even more in its
powerful purple and blue."
[Background]: 'Kitchen'
"Either the Enchantress' cooks a hell of a lot for one person or
she made many magic-based foods for guests. Several shelves
with pots, pans, skillets, and a couple wide cauldrons. She
flipped open cupboards and drawers and a pantry filled with
various sized jars. 
Maybe I missed it, Lena thought. 
One cupboard had a stack of books with pictures of foods.
Flipping through two of thems found only breakfast recepies.
Her stomach growled. Wait, hold on. On the page was a
recepie for an oath. A note was stuck in the spine. It read:
You can't see what lies on the
other side without an apprentice,
(E's real name). Teaching someone
else means the magic keeps going.
You grow as a person, too.
The Enchantress' enjoys the family business. She hates 
this oath part of it."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Wow, thats crazy.
It made a lot more sense to her. What where was the charm
hiding, however?
A moment later:"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(facepalm)
She scurried back to the pantry. Inside, hovering at a
corner behind a jar it leaned - a flat, chestnut-colored
circle. Lena let out a sigh of relief. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I am an idiot for not seeing that.
(for player)
Now I have it all. Lets go back to
her."
[Background]: 'LivingRoom'
"Skylan wouldn't die on her watch. Shortly, the cover of
Strand's Crossing will shield them.
Jogging to the living area, Lena extended the elements in
her hands. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"All four pieces. Here you are."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(nods approvingly)
You did it. Was it difficult?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I missed a few details the first
time."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"You will need to be more aware as
you learn."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(rolls eyes)
Yeah, I realize that. Skylan
teaches me."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"That's good. Or I can. Let's
unseal that door first.
You have no idea how eager I am."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Oh, I do know.
I know its you, Skylan, Lena thouught. The Enchantress has
the wrong hunch. But, I guess we will see."
