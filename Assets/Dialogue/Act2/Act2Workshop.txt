"Workshop."
ENCHANTRESS
First door by the porch.
INT: HOUSE - WORKSHOP.
Two wide glass windows let natural light beam in. Its easier
to see in here than the office, which was musty with one
window. Curls of carved wood litter a hand-powered lathe. A
stack of branches by a table. And a mini forge with a crate
of scrap metal in the corner. 
LENA
Quite an arrangement for such a
dwelling.
What am I looking for?
On the table lay a pile of corks, a line of glass bottles,
and silver soul stones. Lena inspects one.
LENA
Pretty nice ones. The word on it
looks similar to one in Beshat.
A local language shedid not know well. If she hadn't blown a
whole in her parent's barn during the previous attempt
learning it, she'd had given herself another try.
A voice breaks her concentration and makes her flinch.
12.
A VOICE
Who is rummaging about here? Those
soul stones belong to the
Enchantress!
A THIRD VOICE
A guest. Careful - she she might
melt us if we annoy her.
Lena glanced left and right, confused as to who these were.
LENA
Who the heck is speaking?
She stepped further in, eyes sharp. She checked on the floor
and the ceiling before three objects moved dramatically.
A glass bottle, a circular shield, and a wide-nosed hammer
hopped in place.
LENA
(saucer-eyed and jaw
dropped)
I was not aware objects can be
under, um, speaking incantations.
This is just crazy.
TALKING GLASS BOTTLE
Yes, madam. 
TALKING CIRCULAR SHIELD
Says the woman who just walked in.
We're at the Enchantress's service.
TALKING HAMMER
Building the family business for
seven generations. 
Maybe they know enough about her I can find out more, Lena
thought.
LENA
I am kind of lost here. I am
looking for some charm that makes
another charm more effective.
Also, does the Enchantress have a
real name?
TALKING HAMMER
Does it make you float?
LENA
No, it-
13.
TALKING GLASS BOTTLE
Does it remove items stuck to
another?
That is a fast guess, she thought.
LENA
Um, yes, as a matter of fact. The
Enchantress and I need it. For a
project.
TALKING CIRCULAR SHIELD
You refer to her magical name. I
can tell you real name.
LENA
Sure. But I need the charm, too. 
TALKING HAMMER
Grab the orange soul stone with the
forge's tongs. Heat it up. Just
enough will release the charm as
long as you don't drop it.
TALKING CIRCULAR SHIELD
(real name) is her name.
Good businesswoman; persuasive and
powerful. Even though a few from
Strand's Crossing don't like her,
she's remained useful. No one knows
where her parents are.
Lena carefully pinched the tongs on the stone. It was the
length of her whole hand. 
LENA
Interesting.
She held it inside the blazing hot heat. The stone began
quaking. Lena grimaced with sweat beads on her forehead and
her arms searing hot. A few minutes past and it burst apart
- a swirling orange sphere of power the size of a mango. And
she yanked her arms out.
LENA
Ouch!
Yes. Another piece found.
TALKING HAMMER
That's it! Well done. 
TALKING GLASS BOTTLE
Well done, indeed.
LENA
Returning to the Enchantress now.
Thank you.
