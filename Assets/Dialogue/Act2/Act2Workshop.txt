[OUTDATED SHOW STATEMENT]: 'Enchantress, direction, direction, neutral expression'
[Show]: 'Enchantress,Center,Normal'
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"

I want to go to the Workshop."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"First door by the porch."
[Transform]: 'Enchantress,Fade'
[Background]: 'Workshop'
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Two wide glass windows let natural light beam in. Its easier to see in here than the office, which was musty with one window. Curls of carved wood litter a hand-powered lathe. 
A stack of branches by a table. And a mini forge with a crate of scrap metal in the corner. "

[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Quite an arrangement for such a dwelling.
What am I looking for?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"On the table lay a pile of corks, a line of glass bottles,
and silver soul stones. Lena inspects one."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Pretty nice ones. The word on it looks similar to one in Beshat, a local language she did not know well.
If she hadn't blown a hole in her parent's barn during the previous attempt learning it, she'd had given herself another try.
A voice breaks her concentration and makes her flinch."
[Speaker]: 'A voice'
"Who is rummaging about here? Those soul stones belong to the Enchantress!"
[Speaker]: 'Another voice'
"A guest. Careful - she she might
melt us if we annoy her.
Lena glanced left and right, confused as to who these were."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Who the heck is speaking?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She stepped further in, eyes sharp. She checked on the floor
and the ceiling before three objects moved dramatically.
A glass bottle, a circular shield, and a wide-nosed hammer hopped in place."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(saucer-eyed and jaw dropped)
I was not aware objects can be under, um, speaking incantations.
This is just crazy."
[Speaker]: 'Talking Glass Bottle'
"Yes, madam."
[Speaker]: 'Talking Circular Shield'
"Says the woman who just walked in.
We're at the Enchantress's service."
[Speaker]: 'Talking Hammer'
"Building the family business for seven generations."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
[Unspam]: 'Lena'
"(Family business, huh?)
(Maybe they know some stuff about the Enchantress, and what's up with these charms..)"
[Spam]: 'Lena,NormalSpeak,Normal'
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I am kind of lost here. I am looking for some charm that makes another charm more effective.
Also, does the Enchantress have a real name?"
[Speaker]: 'Talking Hammer'
[Unspam]: 'Lena'
"Does it make you float?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"No, it-"
[Speaker]: 'Talking Glass Bottle'
"Does it remove items stuck to another?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"A quick guess, Lena thought.."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Um, yes, as a matter of fact. The Enchantress and I need it. For a project."
[Speaker]: 'Talking Circular Shield'
"You refer to her magical name. I can tell you her real name."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Sure. But I need the charm, too. "
[Speaker]: 'Talking Hammer'
"Grab the orange soul stone with the forge's tongs. Heat it up. Just enough will release the charm as long as you don't drop it."
[Speaker]: 'Talking Circular Shield'
"The Enchantress - Conwenna is her name. 
Good businesswoman; persuasive and powerful. 
Even though a few from Strand's Crossing don't like her, she's remained useful. 
For as long as I've been here, none of the family has uttered their last name. Maybe they never had one..
This house holds many mysteries, and Conwenna is all that remains of that legendary line."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Lena carefully pinched the tongs on the stone. 
It was the length of her whole hand. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Interesting.
She held it inside the blazing hot heat. The stone began quaking. 
Lena grimaced with sweat beads on her forehead and her arms searing hot. 
A few minutes past and it burst apart - a swirling orange sphere of power the size of a mango. 
And she yanked her arms out."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Ouch!"
"Yes. Another piece found."
[Speaker]: 'Talking Hammer'
"That's it! Well done."
[Speaker]: 'Talking Glass Bottle'
"Well done, indeed."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Returning to the Enchantress now.
Thank you."
