"First door by the porch."

[Background]: 'Workshop'
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Two wide glass windows let natural light beam in. It's easier to see in here than the office, which was musty with one window. Curls of carved wood litter a hand-powered lathe. A stack of branches by a table. And a mini forge with a crate of scrap metal in the corner. "

"Quite an arrangement for such a dwelling.
What am I looking for?"
[Speaker]: 'None'

"On the table lay a pile of corks, a line of glass bottles,
and silver soul stones. Lena inspects one."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Pretty nice ones."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"The word on it looks similar to one in Beshat, a local language she did not know well.
If she hadn't blown a hole in her parent's barn during the previous attempt learning it, she'd had given herself another try.
A voice breaks her concentration and makes her flinch."
[Speaker]: 'A voice'
[Transform]: 'Lena,Flip'
"Who is rummaging about here? Those soul stones belong to the Enchantress!"
[Speaker]: 'Another voice'
[Transform]: 'Lena,Flip'
"A guest. Careful - she she might melt us if we annoy her."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Lena glanced left and right, confused as to who these were."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
[Transform]: 'Lena,Flip'
"Who the heck is speaking?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She stepped further in, eyes sharp. She checked on the floor and the ceiling before three objects moved dramatically."

"A glass bottle, a circular shield, and a wide-nosed hammer hopped in place."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(saucer-eyed and jaw dropped)
I was not aware objects can be under, um, speaking incantations.
This is just crazy."
[Speaker]: 'Bottle'
"Yes, madam."

"Says the woman who just walked in.
We're at the Enchantress's service."
[Speaker]: 'Hammer'
"Building the family business for seven generations."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(Family business, huh?)
(Maybe they know some stuff about the Enchantress, and what's up with these charms..)"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I am kind of lost here. I am looking for some charm that makes another charm more effective.
Also, does the Enchantress have a real name?"
[Speaker]: 'Hammer'
[Transform]: 'Lena,Flip'
"Does it make you float?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"No, it-"
[Speaker]: 'Bottle'
"Does it remove items stuck to another?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"A quick guess, Lena thought.."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Um, yes, as a matter of fact. The Enchantress and I need it. For a --"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Revealing her goal would be a mistake, Lena considers. She'd have to keep this a secret, even if they were once told about the door. 
In her mind, Lena saw it: a brief image of being knocked out by a talking hammer. She winced internally. "

"-- project."
[Spam]: 'Lena,NormalSpeak,Normal'
"Also, does she have an actual name? I realize that title fits her, but she must have a common name."
[Transform]: 'Lena,Flip'
[Speaker]: 'Shield'
"You refer to her title. I can tell you her real name."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Sure. But I need the charm, too. "
[Speaker]: 'Bottle'
"Why don't you tell us why you need & it and we can provide a hint?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Well, we are -"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Her lip curls."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"- just preparing something to shield the house for the Arcane Pulse's next firing."
[Speaker]: 'Hammer'
"She looks trustworthy to me.
Grab the orange soul stone with the forge's tongs. Heat it up. Just enough will release the charm as long as you don't drop it."
[Speaker]: 'Shield'
"The Enchantress - Conwenna is her name. 
Good businesswoman; persuasive and powerful. 
Even though a few from Strand's Crossing don't like her, she's remained useful. 
For as long as I've been here, none of the family has uttered their last name. Maybe they never had one..
This house holds many mysteries, and Conwenna is all that remains of that legendary line."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Lena carefully pinched the tongs on the stone. 
It was the length of her whole hand. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Interesting.
She held it inside the blazing hot heat. The stone began quaking. 
Lena grimaced with sweat beads on her forehead and her arms searing hot. 
A few minutes past and it burst apart - a swirling orange sphere of power the size of a mango. 
And she yanked her arms out."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Ouch!"
"Yes. Another piece found."
[Speaker]: 'Hammer'
"That's it! Well done."
[Speaker]: 'Bottle'
"Well done, indeed."
