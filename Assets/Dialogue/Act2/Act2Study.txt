"Study."

"Up the stairs to the left.
She enters. Boxes flanked the wide birchwood desk, a stack
of parchment on the table. A black leather-wrapped sword
hung on the wall. Lena first scans the whole room. Lockpicks
were thin enough to sit almost anywhere. 
She checks each shelf on the single bookshelf."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"None on here.
A small box sat on top of a corner table. Lena looked inside
and saw:"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I would think its here.
Besides, a large chest sat squarely opposite the bookshelf."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Lets try the desk.
Each of its six drawers had some amout of weight. The middle
ones had the most - some cost measuring tools and a ink
wels. In a bottom one, she found a leather book with
'Journal' etched in elegant cursive. Its inside cover read,
'For your business and your stories. To Grandma'. The 'From:'
was blank."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Hmmm.

"Want to see what's behind the
door? Well, take on an apprentice
first. You will need to practice
the advanced abilities before
setting foot inside. Or else, well,
you'll learn the hard way."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Something to keep in mind.
Then, she checked the other bottom drawer. Her fingers
caused the back inner edge to push up the front. A hidden
space. And in it laid two grey metal lockpicks. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(smiles)
There you are."
[Background]: 'HouseMainHall'
"Satisfied, she returned to the main hall. She grinned to the
Enchantress as she revealed them."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Lockpicks found."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(smiling)
Simple enough."
