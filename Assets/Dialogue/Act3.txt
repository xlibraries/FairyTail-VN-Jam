"At once, their shoes skittered down the hall and back down to the basement.
 The Arcane Door stood resolute - candlelight flicking on it as though it will burst open.
 Conwenna observed."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Listen carefully.
 Pun not intended."
"Insert the lockpicks.
 Find the right angles.
 Then speak the unsealing charm, then rotate the tumblers.
 Kind of envelop the amplifier charm over the picks when it's toughest."
[Speaker]: 'None'
 Lena nods, then kneels on the cold stone floor.
 Each lockpick slid in at different angles.
 And she leans in close to hear.
 Each little shift of the pick produced a tiny sound - if she managed to move them."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"One.
 Or that is two?
 .......
 ........................
 ..................................
 Ah - Uh..
 Skylan is more handy than I at this sort of thing.
 Ugh..
 Time for the unsealing charm."
 [Speaker]: 'None'
 Lena activates it by submerging the exposed part of each lock.
 Each becomes outlined by a flare of yellow-brown.
 She moves the picks some more, one eye open."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"C'mon, you piece of junk!"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"The enchantress glares.
Four clicks - each lockpick moved counterclockwise - followed with a metallic twang.
 It did it! Lena shot to her feet wearing an anticipatory smile."

"Sorry.
 It worked!"
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Sure did.
 And who is - that?"

"Hello?"
 "Lena blinks dumfounded: a bruised man leaning against a sloped dirt wall wearing a tan shirt.
 Skylan - he lives!"
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"Skylan! 
 Are you alright?"
 [Speaker]: 'None'
"Skylan looked a little beat up. A few cuts and bruises but nothing substantial."
[Speaker]: 'Lena' 
 "How did you-? "
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
 "Skylans face morphs between surprise as well as relief."

 "Lena clamps herself around him like she won ten thousand gold coins."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"By the Guardians..."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"I thought you were lost."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Yeah.
 No thanks to this.
 (Points to a massive, dark ravine) 
 And.. I didn't haves lockpicks.
 Then there's my companion."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"Conwenna's eyes redden up at admitting the thought of not seeing her grandmother's ghost.
 However, she manages to  accept it. She stifles a sniffle."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Not - 
Not a strange voice after all- 
Grandmother.. didn't make it up!"
[Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Um, Him" 
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"She grips her dagger's hilt.
 Everyone gazes with shock as something huge lurches forward."
[Image]: 'Dragon,Normal'
 "It's a dragon - a big one, towering over the adventurers.
 Leathery green blankets its body and its watchful eyes comb the cavern, clearly aware of their presence. 
 The earth rumbles with its measured, predatory breath.
 Lena felt idiotic for not noticing the beast.
 As for how Skylan survived this long in the midst of such a creature, she had no clue.
 Puzzled, Conwenna examines the doorway felt along its frame: a sizzling, invisible surface."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Its a portal, Lena.
 Grandma's folk tale about the green dragon was real after all."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"(Firm voice) Good thing she kept it at bay."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
 "Conwenna approaches it with caution.
 When she was out of arms reach, it stirs and looks at her.
 Well, down at her."
  [Speaker]: 'Dragon' 
"Ah.
 Conwenna.
 Your grandmother would have been impressed by this,
 if she had seen you unseal the door in less than a year."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
"Conwenna's face contorts as she manages to stay mostly resolute in front of the dragon.
She opens her mouth and a barely controlled question rattles forth."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
 "So.. So she's not here?
  There's nothing? 
  Not ^6^6 - Not even a ghost?"
[Speaker]: 'Dragon'
"The way of the world sometimes demands... sacrifices, and your grandmother was an example of this.
I am sorry.
But, time is running short. The Arcane Pulse gathers, and you have a choice to make:
Uphold my pact with your kin, or sever it.
If you agree, I will assist you in warding off the pulse.
But the price of agreement may be more than you can handle.
If you disagree, I will never interact with your kin nor this town ever again.
I will leave and join my own kin in the distant mountains.
And you and your friends may wait out the pulse here, in this illusionary cave."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"The Enchantress scratches her chin.
She looks back at Lena and Skylan and calls out."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"U- uhh, this is what I know.
 If we go outside, we might not die.
 I might lose a third of my power in the process, or worse.
 Or we can.. be safe in here, but this dragon that my family has known for generations simply leaves.
 I - I'm not sure I can let that happen either.."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
 "Lena had let go of her dagger.
 Gears spun in her head."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"What is the chance of survival out there?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"One in six."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Shucks.
 Had I brought my historical graph scroll, I'd figure out the timing."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"Yeah, that was probably my responsibility.
 And now I know for next time.
 Conwenna, can you try? 
 If it only depletes a third of your power, Skylan and I can get out alive to Strand's Crossing.
 By now, we might not make it even if we had more dragons."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Get to keep him that way."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
 "Conwenna stood facing them. 
 An eternity later, she found herself facing the dragon once more."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Come help me.
 I'll make you small enough to fit through the door."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"The dragon nods its great green snout and rises.
 The Enchantress says a phrase, waves something Lena can't see.
 It shrinks to the size of a large dog.
 At the door, Lena looks her in the eye with a great smile."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"You will be known by everyone who hears our story.
 Your grandmother would be proud."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
"Skylan offers a dirty hand and grimaces with a smile."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
 "What she said."
