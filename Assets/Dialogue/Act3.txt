"At once, their shoes skittered down the hall and back down to the basement.
 The Arcane Door stood resolute - candlelight flicking on it as though it will burst open.
 Conwenna observed."

"Listen carefully.

"Insert the lockpicks.
 Find the right angles.
 Then speak the unsealing charm, then rotate the tumblers.
 Kind of envelop the amplifier charm over the picks when it's toughest."
[Speaker]: 'None'
 Lena nods, then kneels on the cold stone floor.
 Each lockpick slid in at different angles.
 And she leans in close to hear.
 Each little shift of the pick produced a tiny sound - if she managed to move them."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"One.
 Or that is two?
 .......
 ........................
 ..................................
 Ah - Uh..
 Skylan is more handy than I at this sort of thing.
 Ugh..
 Time for the unsealing charm.
 Lena activates it by submerging the exposed part of each lock.
 Each becomes outlined by a flare of yellow-brown.
 She moves the picks some more, one eye open."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"C'mon, you piece of junk!"
[Speaker]: 'None'
The enchantress glares.
"Four clicks - each lockpick moved counterclockwise - followed with a metallic twang.
 It did it! Lena shot to her feet wearing an anticipatory smile.
 And it opens with a dramatic whoosh."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"Sorry.
 It worked!"
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Sure did.
 And who is - that?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
 "Lena blinks dumfounded: a bruised man leaning against a sloped dirt wall wearing a tan shirt.
 Skylan - he lives!"
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"Skylan! 
 Are you alright?"
 [Speaker]: 'None'
"Skylan looked a little beat up. A few cuts and bruises but nothing substantial."
[Speaker]: 'Lena' 
 "How did you-? 
 Skylans face morphs between surprise as well as relief.
 Lena clamps herself around him like she won ten thousand gold coins."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"By the Guardians..."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"I thought you were lost."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Yeah.
 No thanks to this.
 (Points to a massive, dark ravine) 
 And.. I didn't haves lockpicks.
 Then there's my companion."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"Conwenna's eyes redden up at admitting the thought of not seeing her grandmother's ghost.
 However, she manages to  accept it. She stifles a sniffle."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Not - 
Not a strange voice after all- 
Grandmother.. didn't make it up!"
[Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Um, Him" 
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"She grips her dagger's hilt.
 Everyone gazes with shock as something huge lurches forward.
 It's a dragon - a big one, towering over the adventurers.
 Leathery green blankets its body and its watchful eyes comb the cavern, clearly aware of their presence. 
 The earth rumbles with its measured, predatory breath.
 Lena felt idiotic for not noticing the beast.
 As for how Skylan survived this long in the midst of such a creature, she had no clue.
 Puzzled, Conwenna examines the doorway felt along its frame: a sizzling, invisible surface."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Its a portal, Lena.
 Grandma's folk tale about the green dragon was real after all."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"(Firm voice) Good thing she kept it at bay."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
 "Conwenna approaches it with caution.
 When she was out of arms reach, it stirs and looks at her.
 Well, down at her."
  [Speaker]: 'Dragon' 
"Ah.
 Conwenna.
 Your grandmother would have been impressed by this,
 if she had seen you unseal the door in less than a year."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
"Conwenna's face contorts as she manages to stay mostly resolute in front of the dragon.
She opens her mouth and a barely controlled question rattles forth."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
 "So.. So she's not here?
  There's nothing? 
  Not ^6^6 - Not even a ghost?"
[Speaker]: 'Dragon'
"The way of the world sometimes demands... sacrifices, and your grandmother was an example of this.
I am sorry.
But, time is running short. The Arcane Pulse gathers, and you have a choice to make:
Uphold my pact with your kin, or sever it.
If you agree, I will assist you in warding off the pulse.
But the price of agreement may be more than you can handle.
If you disagree, I will never interact with your kin nor this town ever again.
I will leave and join my own kin in the distant mountains.
And you and your friends may wait out the pulse here, in this illusionary cave."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"The Enchantress scratches her chin.
She looks back at Lena and Skylan and calls out."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"U- uhh, this is what I know.
 If we go outside, we might not die.
 I might lose a third of my power in the process, or worse.
 Or we can.. be safe in here, but this dragon that my family has known for generations simply leaves.
 I - I'm not sure I can let that happen either.."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
 "Lena had let go of her dagger.
 Gears spun in her head."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"What is the chance of survival out there?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"One in six."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Shucks.
 Had I brought my historical graph scroll, I'd figure out the timing."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"Yeah, that was probably my responsibility.
 And now I know for next time.
 Conwenna, can you try? 
 If it only depletes a third of your power, Skylan and I can get out alive to Strand's Crossing.
 By now, we might not make it even if we had more dragons."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
"Get to keep him that way."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
 "Conwenna stood facing them. 
 An eternity later, she found herself facing the dragon once more."
 [Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Come help me.
 I'll make you small enough to fit through the door."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"The dragon nods its great green snout and rises.
 The Enchantress says a phrase, waves something Lena can't see.
 It shrinks to the size of a large dog.
 At the door, Lena looks her in the eye with a great smile."
 [Speaker]: 'Lena' 
"You will be known by everyone who hears our story.
 Your grandmother would be proud."
 [Speaker]: 'None' 
"Skylan offers a dirty hand and grimaces with a smile."
 [Speaker]: 'Skylan' 
 "What she said."
[Speaker]: 'None' 
[Background]: 'Forest'
"They exit the ravine and fast walk back up the basement stairs.
Conwenna left it unlocked.
Their guess was almost right: the woods were afire with purple, pulsating roots. The trees thrummed with terrible distortions.
The sky crackled and shone with a fell light that made their hearts sink.
Conwenna and the Dragon stood together on the lawn. The dragon, at full size, spread its wings in readiness.
Skylan and Lena huddled together on the porch, feeling quite exposed.
Then it came.
The wind howled,
the ground shook,
and the sky rumbled,
as purple waves tore through the forest with heavy ferocity.
But they broke at the tree line, spreading round and drifting by the house.
It was working - they were doing it!
For a couple minutes, they sat there in the hideous storm, holding off the danger wave by wave.
At once, Conwenna let out a beleaguered cry."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress' 
"Lena!
I need you!
We can't hold on much longer - come up here!"
[Speaker]: 'None' 
"Lena wobbled up to the field, and stood next to the Dragon and Conwenna. Not sure what to do, she held out her hands and immediately felt it.
The terror - the overwhelming power slamming on her soul. She found herself locked in a leaning stance, already fighting hard to stay on her feet.
It was scary, but she remembered the roots, and told herself hesitantly that there wasn't much of a difference.
She clenched her teeth and fought. 
The waves bebegancan to buckle, shift, and lessen.
With all three of them, the Pulse was held at bay.
At the end of it, Lena and Conwenna collapsed on the ground, alive but exhausted."





 And their guess was almost right: every tree with purple pulsating roots around sounded with distortions.
 Her and the dragon, returned to normal size, stood tall in her lawn with its wings spread.
 Lena and Skylan huddled inside the cracked open door.
 Each time the Pulse hit it, it bounced off, to everyone's relief.
  EPILOGUE Lena meets with Conwenna on the weekends at the house.
 Became pretty good at the tougher powers the more they sparr.
 Her enormous appetite for knowledge caused Lena to learn much on the fly.
 Skylan still wanders the woods when safe to do so.
 From Strand's Crossing if need be.
 He visits Lena and their new friend regularly, being careful with his footing.
 Conwenna - the Enchantress - spends her weekends training her new apprentice and making minor politics.
 Selling potions and powers continued being the main business.
 Her othe goal of becoming a truly powerful sorceress will help her tap into the Arcane Pulse, studying and improving so much she may put the mages at Strand's Crossing to shame.
 She misses her grandmother, however, no longer grieves.
