"They exit the ravine and fast walk back up the basement stairs.
Conwenna left it unlocked.
Their guess was almost right: the woods were afire with purple, pulsating roots. The trees thrummed with terrible distortions.
The sky crackled and shone with a fell light that made their hearts sink.
Conwenna and the Dragon stood together on the lawn. The dragon, at full size, spread its wings in readiness.
Skylan and Lena huddled together on the porch, feeling quite exposed.
Then it came."

"The wind howled,
the ground shook,
and the sky rumbled,
as purple waves tore through the forest with heavy ferocity.
But they broke at the tree line, spreading round and drifting by the house.
It was working - they were doing it!
For a couple minutes, they sat there in the hideous storm, holding off the danger wave by wave.
At once, Conwenna let out a beleaguered cry."

I need you!

"Lena wobbled up to the field, and stood next to the Dragon and Conwenna. Not sure what to do, she held out her hands and immediately felt it."

"The terror - the overwhelming power slamming on her soul. She found herself locked in a leaning stance, already fighting hard to stay on her feet.
It was scary, but she remembered the roots, and told herself hesitantly that there wasn't much of a difference.
She clenched her teeth and fought. 
The waves began to buckle, shift, and lessen.
With all three of them, the Pulse was held at bay.
At the end of it, Lena and Conwenna collapsed on the ground, alive but exhausted.
They laid there on the ground for a while, but eventually came to."

"With her eyes closed, drained of power, Lena gasped on the grass."

"We... We did it!"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"... Y- Yes.
I wasn't sure if you would have enough power to help, but..
I'm so glad you did.
I won't forget this."

"EPILOGUE
 Lena meets with Conwenna on the weekends at the house.
 Became pretty good at the tougher powers the more they spar.
 Her enormous appetite for knowledge caused Lena to learn much on the fly.
 Skylan still wanders the woods when safe to do so.
 From Strand's Crossing if need be.
 He visits Lena and their new friend regularly, being careful with his footing.
 Conwenna - the Enchantress - spends her weekends training her new apprentice and making minor politics.
 Selling potions and powers continued being the main business.
 Her other goal of becoming a truly powerful sorceress will help her tap into the Arcane Pulse, studying and improving so much she may put the mages at Strand's Crossing to shame.
 She misses her grandmother, however, no longer grieves."
