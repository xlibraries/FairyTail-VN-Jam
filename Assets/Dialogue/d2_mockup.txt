Surprised I haven't found him yet.
{i0}Ten days ought to be plenty of
time. 
 {i0} If only I knew a tracking ability...
 {i0} But, last I remember there's a
 city near here. 
 {i0} Perhaps they can
 help. 
 {i0} Last thing I need to see is
 him captured,  or lying on the
 ground bleeding from an orc attack.
{i0}  Yeah - learn some magic. Find his
 ass and get him home. I just hope
 he is alive.
 Lena resumes walking. She will know her whereabouts once she
 gets out of this birchhwood forest soon. In the meanwhile,{r0.2}

 {i0} I knew I should have brought my
 bullhorn.
