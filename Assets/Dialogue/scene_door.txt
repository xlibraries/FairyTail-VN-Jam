"I should have checked the library first, Lena thought as she paced down the hall.
A houseplant on a corner stand welcomed her.
Hanging on the wall opposite was a slab of strong, deep brown scales, reflecting light from a sun roon window.
Above it, a talon the length of her forearm. She paused."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Quite a trophy! Strange choice with roses by the other wall."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She continued down to the library.
At last she passed by it: {i0} The Forbidden door at the Mezzanine.
A thick slab of metal accented by a raised edge.
Stamped at its center was a family crest.
However, dust and discoloration made seeing it all difficult.
Lena leaned forward and, risking one check, rapped knuckles against it."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Skylan? Are you back there?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"The voice made a distant response.
Like it was at the very back of the room scared to speak up."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Whoever is stuck back there, I'm here to help.
It won't be long.
Gotta get you out before the orcs smash this house up."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Whoever was stuck raised their voice an octave higher.
And sneered."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"What the?"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Doggonit, she thought.
Lena planted a fist on the metal."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Urrhh!! If you're not Skylan, then & I am beating your arse when I rip this thing off its hinges.
I hope he is still alive.
I hope you are still there, my friend. You owe me a drink."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She swallowed a sniffle and sighed.
It wasn't like she was locked in an endless dungeon with traps and skeletons waiting.
This place belonged to a grieving granddaughter.
But^6.^6.^6. was she hiding more?
She didn't appear that way.
Really, the enchantress seemed just as interested in the door as she was, Lena thought.
Maybe she doesn't know what's behind it either...
An uncomfortable air and the pressure of time pushed her - without thought - into the next room.
After all, the library door was wide open.
There was a small cobweb in the corner of the opening..
That broomstick can handle it, she thought, and stepped right in."
[Background]: 'Library'
"Lena got right to work.
For a house this size, this library was quite expansive.
All four walls lined with shelves, a couple full armor suits in corners, and a chandeler - relatively small - throwing light all around with its candles.
Its rope was secured around a wall hook.
But only five shelves high was every wall stacked; on the top of each shelf was a jumble of tools. 
M.. magic tools? Maybe.
An unkempt stack of books sat on a table in the mdist."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Alrighty.
I need the last word or two. And where to start.^6.^6.^6.
I don't have time to look through all these... Wish I knew an incantation or something that
told me which books matter."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Just then, the house's front door slamed shut.
Multiple voices conferred and one jogged down the hall."
[Show]: 'Enchantress,RightCenterDown,angry'
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"I've brought assistance! They may know more about the door. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Oh, good. Maybe they know the phrase to open that door. She received a shake of the head."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Two are soldiers and one is a&farmer's daughter - an old friend.&"&I brought a few arrows, more&abelith, and red wine.& And a ring&for shooting fire.&
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Better than no help at all. 
Well, I need one or two last words. Probably in guidebooks."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Oh yes. Check the bottom shelves facing you.
By the way^6.^6.^6. if you go to the far corner^6, try not to scream."
[Speaker]: 'None'
While thumbing through books^6, Lena shuddered and froze^6, turning her gaze to the enchantress."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Why?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"It's^6.^6.^6. unusual.
Lena glares at her, needing more information."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Its a creature stuck in time.
By the way, OUR ^6^6 time is growing shorter.
Let me help."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"The best thing she's said this day, Lena thought."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Ah, here is one... 'Words for Everyday Use.'"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"She rifles through its thick pages.
Instant cleaning spells^6.^6.^6. 
Ignite a fire in your fireplace^6.^6.^6.
Hammer a nail^6.^6.^6. 
Grab a far branch...
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
(shaking head).. Nothing...
[Speaker]: 'None'
The enchantress sifts through the pile on the table, scooting a book off of another.
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"This one's for entrap - UH - {r0.2} woodworking! It should be in the workshop."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Speaking of ^6.^6.^6. There's a fairy locked in a cube. With a ring."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"The woman's voice teeters to a suspiciously higher pitch as words struggle to leave her mouth."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Ohhh!
You met Kombum.
He's..^6^6 He's good, as fairies go.
No need to worry~!
I need to let him out again. Uh.."
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Interesting, Lena thought.
Rules it out of being a bad guy.
Fairies can be a thorn in your side, after all.
Suddenly, her eyes caught a book of fair make.."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"'Magic Abilities for Attack and Defense 101.'"
