[Background]: 'Forest'
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Let me try again, Skylan. I think I
know why it didn't work that time.
Then you take your turn."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"Fourth time is a charm, I guess.
Not the third. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(steadies breath)
My hand muscles cramp before I can
generate enough power."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"Its simple: focus on the object.
Not its surroundings."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"That is what I am attempting, you
realize."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"Well, you can be better."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(scowls)"
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"(chuckles)
I am only giving you a hard time,
Lena. You can do it."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(changes to a smile)
Thank you. Then, I hand you your
butt."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"Not if the Arcane Pulse fires
early. We'll need to shield up at
Strand's Crossing ASAP.
Wise idea, Lena thought. Albeit, she wasn't planning on
beating him up. She extended her arm again toward the dense
tree several feet away, then made a claw with her fingers.
Purple tree roots crackled and slid as they separated.
The longer she focused, the more the saw how intertwined
they were. The roots stiffened up like they resisted her.
She let go and let out a stressed breath."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Piece of crap. 
My power output must need work.
He claps her on the shoulder."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"You will get it. Just like last
week. Give it another go before we
head to the Crossing.
Every four years it builds up, then discharges as a wave for
five miles wherever it is established, making the woods
unsafe to travel through for five days. Ironically, it is
also stunning to look at."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"If I had a teacher I'd have no
issue. The thing is - there is not
one at home. Nor one over at
Strand's Crossing.
If we were strong enough, we can be
outside during it. Always have
wanted to gaze upon all those
colors. Like something with
lightning."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"(glances to the woods'
canopy)
Definitely is a sight to behold. 
Lena walks around the outer edge of the nearest trees - some
without purple veins. Maybe she was just thirsty. So, she
gulped apple juice from her canteen."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Juice break. Go find those herbs. I
will wait here."
[Speaker]: 'Skylan'
"Will be lucky if I do find them. 
Skylan walks off between trees. After quenching her thirst,
Lena knew other abilities she can practice while waiting,
like levitating heavy stones. Three tries it took for a
hefty, moss-covered stone to lift to three times here height
and sit atop two more.
Mmmm, success, she thought. She switched it up to an evade -
a magic-aided sideways burst of speed. One worked out before
she tripped."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Dang it. I need Skylan as a target
for this.
Some time had passed based on the height of the sun. She
also noticed he had yet to return. Odd, she thought. She
scanned the immediate area.
Not here. Not in the trees."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Where did he go? Get stuck on a
thorn bush?
This is unusual for him. I need to
look for him before the Pulse goes
off. He knows his way around these
woods better than I, though.
INT: DEEP IN EASTERN FOREST. AFTERNOON.
She double checks the perimeter. It's as calm as crickets. A
pat of her dagger reassured her before entering the trees.
For an unknown amount of time, she looked behind thick
trunks, fallen logs, or up tree canopies. A slope took her
up and over to bigger trees. "
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(Internal thinking shown
on screen)
 This isn't good.
Her heart thuds in her chest. She fast walks between brush
and hops over large logs. That is when she noticed them:
purple veins glistening brighter while filling with
electrical pulses."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Crap.
Which-which way would he have gone?
Lena spun in circles. Some orange herbs here start a path.
She picks a direction based on tiny orange leaves and
follows."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Lets try this way.
I knew I should have brought my
Ithaka bullhorn.
Writers' Note: Ithaka Bullhorn is a magical horn
Note
capable of far-reaching sound waves. Helps alert people
or find them if they're within a five mile radius. 
She sees something ahead. Looks bright and wide, like a
barn with earthly colors. A ways along the leaves end at a
clearing. Lena scans the area to make sure no one jumps
her. 
Nope. No sign of Skylan either. Lena approaches it
cautiously with a hand on her dagger's handle."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(frowning)
Is this a hideout?"
[Background]: 'House'
"Crates set along a side, a wheelbarrow with a mountain of
dirt sat next to them, smoke rose from the stone chimney,
and a wood porch gave an industrious presence. Two stories
of it too - a home. It is a lot of space for being in the
midst of the woods."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(Internal dialogue on
screen)
Someone lives way out here. Golly.
I wonder how close Strand's
Crossing is too here."
[May need to fudge the dialogue here - a closeup on the porch could be too much?]
[Background]: 'House'
"On the front porch, Lena noticed a figure move. They're
sitting on a chair with hands on their face. Green dress,
red-brown hair. Ahh, now she recalled - The Enchantress.
Dangerous, powerful, older than her, and highly
knowledgeable. She could bypass her in silence, but, she may
be the only person for acres.
What other option is there? The trees will be too dangerous
to climb and Skylan will get zapped by the Arcane Pulse.
She hears sniffling. Now, Lena decides to be formal about
it."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(curious)
Um, hi. "
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(Flinches. Looks around.)
Who's that?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Sorry. You must be the Enchantress,
right? Are you okay?"
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(Sees her. Sniffles)
I am. No, but I will survive.
You are?
Lena considers between telling her real name or keeping
it secret. To trust someone she has only heard of, first
name basis is rather necessary."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Lena.
Have you seen a younger guy around
these parts? I'm looking for my
friend after he went looking for
magic herbs. 
The Enchantress lifts her head and sits straight on her
bench. Her eyes are apricot red."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"Can you provide some details?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Five-foot-ten, brown hair and
pants. Carrying a rucksack."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(shakes head)
Haven't. 
(wipes nose with
handkerchief)
However, I know magic that can help
you find him. 
Having a powerful and dangerous enchantress help is pretty
overkill. She may betray them for her own needs. Again,
though, no one else was around."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I am in a hurry, so yes, please."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"What is his name?"
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Skylan."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"(nods gently and stands
up)
Alright, sure. Under one condition."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Of course, there's that. Okay. "
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"You help me unlock a door that my
grandmother - may she now rest in
peace - forbade me from opening.
She called it the Forbidden Door. 
It just requires a bit of arcane
abilities. So more like The Arcane
Door.
Help break a family pact for finding her friend. Not what
Lena imagined."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"I've struggled with those. You can
teach me what I need to find my
friend and I will open it."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"You have a deal. 
Door's down in my basement. I'll
show you."
[Background]: 'HouseMainHall'
[Speaker]: 'None'
"The Enchantress long stride had Lena fast walk. The candle
lights are low, but rays of yellow sun illuminate the whole
place. A little bird chirps in a wood cage in the kitchen. A
landscape painting of a castle by a river hangs on the wall."
[Background]: 'ArcaneDoor'
[Speaker]: 'None'
"Quiet place, Lena observed. It made the house look longer
than it actually was. Boxes and household tools and a basin
of water. Bits and bobs in boxes or wrapped in cloth. At the
back is a hefty wood door. Metal hinges wrap themselves
along a side. Paintings of fantastical creatures stretched
along the top and bottom. Candelight mounted on a chandelier
casted angular shadows. Just one narrow window let in light."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"(eyes wide)
Ummm-
This looks like bad news."
[Speaker]: 'Enchantress'
"I understand that. You did agree."
[Speaker]: 'Lena'
"Ehh, I will take my chances at-"
[Speaker]: 'None'
"A muffled voice sounds behind the door. Is that - is that
him?!"
